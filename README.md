### 2. 4D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering
- **Authors**: Guanjun Wu, Taoran Yi, Jiemin Fang, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Wei Wei, Wenyu Liu, Tian Qi, Xinggang Wang
- **Abstract**: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes has been an important but challenging task. Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to maintain. We introduce the 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) to achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering... (shortened for readability)

## Diffusion 3D Gaussian Splatting

### 1. DreamGaussian: Generative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Content Creation
- **Authors**: Jiaxiang Tang, Jiawei Ren, Hang Zhou, Ziwei Liu, Gang Zeng
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in 3D content creation mostly leverage optimization-based 3D
generation via score distillation sampling (SDS). Though promising results have
been exhibited, these methods often suffer from slow per-sample optimization,
limiting their practical usage.... (shortened for readability)

### 2. Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting
- **Authors**: Zilong Chen, Feng Wang, Huaping Liu
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN),
a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer
from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and
proper representation... (shortened for readability)
